<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello there! I'm Jordan Quarles, a passionate and creative web developer with a love for turning ideas into digital realities. I thrive on the challenges of coding and believe in the power of technology to make a positive impact on the world. My journey into web development began with a curiosity to understand how websites work. From those early days of tinkering with HTML and CSS, I've come a long way, honing my skills in front-end and back-end development, as well as various web technologies and frameworks.

  I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I enjoy crafting responsive and user-friendly websites that deliver seamless experiences across devices. Additionally, I have experience working with popular libraries and frameworks like React and Vue.js, allowing me to build dynamic and interactive web applications.
  
  My passion for learning and staying updated with the latest trends drives me to continuously explore new technologies and tools. I believe in the importance of clean, maintainable code, and I always strive to write code that not only works but also follows best practices.
  
  Collaboration and teamwork are essential aspects of my work style. I enjoy being part of a creative and diverse team, where ideas flow freely, and we collectively bring innovative solutions to life.
